An exclusive, members-only web app where users can post anonymous stories. While logged-in members can see who authored each post, the outside world can only read the stories — never knowing who wrote them.

This app is built with:

Node.js + Express — for server-side logic and routing

PostgreSQL — for storing users and posts securely

Passport.js — for user authentication with sessions

bcrypt — for secure password hashing

Features:
User registration and login system

Passwords securely hashed with bcrypt

Role-based access: only authenticated users can see authors

Public-facing posts remain anonymous

PostgreSQL-backed data storage for users and posts

Session management with Passport and Express
